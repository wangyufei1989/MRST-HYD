# MRST-HYD

This repository contains all the files for library: MRST-HYD, which is a toolbox for simulating offshore CO2 storage with hydrate formation. We offer four example case simulations for the purpose of introduction.  Users can learn MRST-HYD through these four given examples. Details about each exapmple are described inside the script.

**Installation**

MRST-HYD is handy, and no extra operation is needed to install MRST-HYD. (One can directly run the Matlab script stored in the folder 'MRST-HYD/examples/'.) 


**Quick start (only for those who have zero knowledge of Matlab)**

* Launch Matlab Software
* Go to the folder 'MRST-HYD/examples/one_dimensional_Joule_Thomson_with_HYD_formation' 
* Open the Matlab script 'one_dimensional_Joule_Thomson_with_HYD_formation.m'
* Click on 'run' button



**Software requirement**

Only Matlab is needed (version 2019b or higher).

**Acknowledgement**

 We acknowledge the discussion with Dr. Maarten W. Saaltink (UPC- Barcelona Tech) during the early modeling stage.  We are  indebted to  Isabelle Faille (IFPEN) for organizing the discussion of this work. This code is a work from the Postdoc project (2022/12-2023/12) of IFP Energies nouvelles (Wang et al., 2023), and it is an extension of the PhD thesis of Wang (2022). The code is developed based on the platform called MRST (version 2016b) (Lie,2019).
