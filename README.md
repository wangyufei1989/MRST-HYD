# MRST-HYD

This repository contains all the files for library: MRST-HYD, which is a toolbox for simulating offshore CO2 storage with hydrate formation. We offer four example case simulations for the purpose of introduction.  Users can learn MRST-HYD through these four given examples. Details about each exapmple are described inside the script.

**Installation**

MRST-HYD is handy, and no explicit operation is needed to install MRST-HYD. One only need to go into folder 'MRST-HYD/examples/', then go into one of the four subfolders each containing one example test, and choose the Matlab script inside this subfolder and run it.  


**Quick start (only for those who have zero knowledge of Matlab)**

* Launch Matlab Software
* Go to the folder 'MRST-HYD/examples/one_dimensional_Joule_Thomson_with_HYD_formation' 
* Open the Matlab script 'one_dimensional_Joule_Thomson_with_HYD_formation.m'
* Click on 'run' button

**Platform**

. 



**Software requirement**

Only Matlab is needed. The current module is developed based on Matlab 2019b, and it should be compatible for new versions of Matlab.
